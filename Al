# AI-powered Accessibility Scanner

The AI-powered Accessibility Scanner (a11y scanner) is a GitHub Action that detects accessibility barriers across your digital products, creates trackable issues, and leverages GitHub Copilot for AI-powered fixes.

The a11y scanner helps teams:

- 🔍 Scan websites, repositories, and dynamic content for accessibility issues
- 📝 Create actionable GitHub issues that can be assigned to GitHub Copilot
- 🤖 Propose fixes with GitHub Copilot, with humans reviewing before merging

> ⚠️ **Note:** The a11y scanner is currently in public preview. Feature development work is still ongoing. It can help identify accessibility gaps but cannot guarantee fully accessible code suggestions. Always review before merging!

## [Frequently-Asked Questions (FAQ)](FAQ.md)

## Requirements

To use the a11y scanner, you'll need:

- **GitHub Actions** enabled in your repository
- **GitHub Issues** enabled in your repository
- **Available GitHub Actions minutes** for your account
- **Admin access** to add repository secrets
- **GitHub Copilot** (optional) - The a11y scanner works without GitHub Copilot and will still create issues for accessibility findings. However, without GitHub Copilot, you won't be able to automatically assign issues to GitHub Copilot for AI-powered fix suggestions and PR creation.

## Getting started

### 1. Add a workflow file

Create a workflow file in `.github/workflows/` (e.g., `a11y-scan.yml`) in your repository:

```yaml
name: Accessibility Scanner
on: workflow_dispatch # This configures the workflow to run manually, instead of (e.g.) automatically in every PR. Check out https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#on for more options.

jobs:
  accessibility_scanner:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: github/accessibility-scanner@v3
        with:
          urls: | # Provide a newline-delimited list of URLs to scan; more information below.
            REPLACE_THIS
          repository: REPLACE_THIS/REPLACE_THIS # Provide a repository name-with-owner (in the format "primer/primer-docs"). This is where issues will be filed and where Copilot will open PRs; more information below.
          token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }} # This token must have write access to the repo above (contents, issues, and PRs); more information below. Note: GitHub Actions' GITHUB_TOKEN cannot be used here.
          cache_key: REPLACE_THIS # Provide a filename that will be used when caching results. We recommend including the name or domain of the site being scanned.
          # base_url: https://REPLACE_THIS # Optional: GitHub API base URL to pass into Octokit (required for GitHub Enterprise Server)
          # login_url: # Optional: URL of the login page if authentication is required
          # username: # Optional: Username for authentication
          # password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }} # Optional: Password for authentication (use secrets!)
          # auth_context: # Optional: Stringified JSON object for complex authentication
          # skip_copilot_assignment: false # Optional: Set to true to skip assigning issues to GitHub Copilot (or if you don't have GitHub Copilot)
          # include_screenshots: false # Optional: Set to true to capture screenshots and include links to them in filed issues
          # open_grouped_issues: false # Optional: Set to true to open an issue grouping individual issues per violation
          # group_by: finding # Optional: 'finding' (default, one issue per violation), 'rule' (one per rule), or 'rule+url' (one per rule per URL)
          # file_best_practice_issues: true # Optional: Set to false to stop filing new issues for best-practice findings (recommendations that are not hard WCAG failures)
          # file_experimental_issues: true # Optional: Set to false to stop filing new issues for experimental findings (checks that are not yet stable)
          # dry_run: false # Optional: Set to true to scan and log what would be filed without creating/closing issues or writing the cache
          # reduced_motion: no-preference # Optional: Playwright reduced motion configuration option
          # color_scheme: light # Optional: Playwright color scheme configuration option
          # scans: '["axe","accesslint","reflow-scan"]' # Optional: An array of scans (or plugins) to be performed. Built-in engines are 'axe' and 'accesslint'; any other entry is a plugin name. If not provided, only Axe will be performed.
          # url_configs: '[{"url":"https://example.com","excludeSelectors":["iframe","#widget"]}]' # Optional: Per-URL config with CSS selectors to exclude from the Axe scan. When provided, takes precedence over 'urls'.
```

**Required permissions:**

- Write access to add or update workflows
- Admin access to add repository secrets

### 2. Create a token and add a secret

The a11y scanner requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) as a repository secret:

**The `GH_TOKEN` is a fine-grained PAT with:**

- `actions: write`
- `contents: write`
- `issues: write`
- `pull-requests: write`
- `metadata: read`
- **Scope:** Your target repository (where issues and PRs will be created) and the repository containing your workflow

> 👉 GitHub Actions' default [GITHUB_TOKEN](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token) cannot be used here.

### 3. Run your first scan

Trigger the workflow manually or automatically based on your configuration. The a11y scanner will run and create issues for any accessibility findings. When issues are assigned to GitHub Copilot, always review proposed fixes before merging.

## Authentication

If access to a page requires logging-in first, and logging-in requires only a username and password, then provide the `login_url`, `username`, and `password` inputs.

If your login flow is more complex—if it requires two-factor authentication, single sign-on, passkeys, etc.—and you have a custom action that [authenticates with Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth) and persists authenticated session state to a file, then provide the `auth_context` input. (If `auth_context` is provided, `login_url`, `username`, and `password` will be ignored.)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't put passwords in your workflow as plain text; instead reference a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

---

## Keeping an issue closed with `wontfix`

When the scanner files an issue for an accessibility finding and that same finding turns up again on a later run, it reopens closed issues so the problem doesn't get lost. Sometimes, though, you may want a closed issue to _stay_ closed -- for example, if you've decided not to act on a particular finding, or if you're already tracking the work outside of GitHub issues.

To stop the scanner from reopening a closed issue, add the **`wontfix`** label to it. On its next run, the scanner sees the label and skips reopening the issue, leaving it closed.

## Configuring GitHub Copilot

The a11y scanner leverages GitHub Copilot coding agent, which can be configured with custom instructions:

- **Repository-wide:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Directory/file-scoped:** `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`

## Plugins

See the [plugin docs](https://github.com/github/accessibility-scanner/tree/main/PLUGINS.md) for more information, including how to load plugins published to npm.

### Alt Text Plugin

The [Alt Text Plugin](https://github.com/github/accessibility-scanner-alt-text-plugin) is a first-party scanner plugin published to npm as [`@github/accessibility-scanner-alt-text-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/accessibility-scanner-alt-text-plugin). It flags low-quality `alt` text that can pass Axe's `image-alt` rule, including vague or generic descriptions, raw filenames, repeated text, and placeholder values. The scanner installs the package at runtime; to enable it, add the plugin to the `scans` input using its package name:

```yaml

## How We Decide What to Build Next

We love hearing ideas and suggestions from the community — your feedback genuinely helps shape our thinking. That said, we want to be upfront: **there's no guarantee that any specific feature request will be implemented.**

Our team prioritizes upcoming work based on a number of factors, including:

- Alignment with the Action's core mission (website accessibility scanning)
- The complexity and scope of the work involved
- How many users would benefit from the change
- Our current bandwidth and roadmap commitments

We read every suggestion and appreciate the time people take to share them. Even if we can't act on a request right away (or at all), it still helps us understand what matters most to the people using this tool. So please keep the ideas coming — just know that we can't make promises about what will or won't ship.
